The Israeli government's Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (Cogat), the body overseeing Palestinian civilian affairs, said Israel had decided to close all crossings in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, including the Rafah crossing, until further notice. The statement added that the decision applies to all Palestinians except those with \"essential worker permits\", and that these permits would be issued through specific crossings. Cogat claimed that the closure of the crossings in Gaza wouldn’t affect the humanitarian situation in the Strip. In the West Bank, hundreds of Palestinians were stranded at the closed barriers and iron gates until late into the night, with some forced to sleep in their vehicles or at relatives' homes. ,,, https://www. middleeasteye.net/news/israel- closes-rafah-crossing-checkpoint-west-bank-gaza-strip # gaza # palestine # WestBank # israel",

      "text": "Iran is facing a bitter scene; a scene that passed over Afghanistan twenty-five years ago. During the global coalition and American occupation, Iran was among the leading countries that provided good assistance to the West during the occupation. As neighbors, we sincerely regret the current situation in Iran. But \"what's ours is ours;\" meaning, if they had shown compassion and good neighborliness twenty-five years ago, and instead of overthrowing our regime, had at least cooperated with us in intelligence matters as a fellow Muslim country, the situation in the East would not be as it is today. It is clear to everyone the extent of the injustice, oppression, and aggression that the Shiite Safavid clerical regime in Iran has inflicted upon Sunni Muslims worldwide. Twenty years ago, in Iraq, Syria, Yemen, Jordan, and Afghanistan, they exploited opportunities to provide intelligence assistance to Zionists and, through killings, imprisonment, and marginalizing Sunni Muslims from political matters, they created a Shia empire. Later, when Zionists realized that this empire could become a source of trouble for them, they took action, the result of which was the assassination of the leader of this empire. The political situation in Iran is changing, and there is a high probability of an internal crisis emerging, even to the point that there may be no consensus in choosing a new leader. The last opportunity for the late leader's close associates is to attack Israel and America with all their might. If the atmosphere calms down, perhaps the situation they desire will not be repeated. Overall, the assassination of Iran's leader sends the message to the Muslim community that if Muslims do not transcend sectarian and nationalistic demands and do not unite, they will continue to be targeted wherever they are. ایران با آن صحنه تلخی روبه‌رو است؛ صحنه‌ای که بیست‌وپنج سال پیش بر افغانستان گذشت. در دوران ائتلاف جهانی و اشغال آمریکایی، ایران از جمله کشورهای پیشگامی بود که در زمان اشغال به غربی‌ها کمک خوبی کرد. ما به‌عنوان همسایه، از وضعیت کنونی ایران از صمیم قلب متأسف هستیم. اما «هرچه بر ماست از ماست»؛ یعنی اگر آنان ۲۵ سال پیش دلسوزی و حسن همجواری نشان می‌دادند و به‌جای سرنگونی نظام ما، حداقل به‌عنوان یک کشور مسلمان همکاری اطلاعاتی با ما می‌کردند، امروز وضعیت در شرق آن‌گونه که هست، نمی‌بود. این‌که نظام آخوندی صفوی شیعه‌مذهب مستقر در ایران با اهل سنت مسلمانان جهان چه اندازه ظلم، اجحاف و تعدی کرده، بر همه روشن است. آنان بیست سال پیش در عراق، سوریه، یمن، اردن و افغانستان با استفاده از فرصت، به کمک‌های اطلاعاتی صهیونیست‌ها پرداختند و در این کشورها با کشتار، زندانی کردن و دور نگه‌داشتن اهل سنت از مسائل سیاسی، یک امپراتوری شیعی ایجاد کردند. بعدها وقتی صهیونیست‌ها دریافتند که این امپراتوری می‌تواند برای آنان دردسرساز شود، در برابرش اقدام کردند و نتیجه آن امروز به کشته شدن رهبر این امپراتوری انجامید. وضعیت سیاسی در ایران در حال تغییر است و احتمال زیادی وجود دارد که بحران داخلی به‌وجود آید، حتی تا جایی که در تعیین رهبر جدید شاید نظر واحدی شکل نگیرد. آخرین فرصت نزدیکان رهبر کشته‌شده این است که با تمام توان به اسرائیل و آمریکا حمله کنند. اگر فضا آرام شود، شاید وضعیت آن‌گونه که آنان می‌خواهند، دیگر تکرار نشود. در مجموع، کشته شدن رهبر ایران برای امت مسلمان این پیام را دارد که اگر مسلمانان از خواسته‌های فرقه‌ای و ملیتی عبور نکنند و متحد نشوند، همچنان در هرجا هدف قرار خواهند گرفت Source: شهاب لېوال Shahab lewal313 (@Shahablewal313) [ https:// x.com/Shahablewal313/status/20 28011844858749416 ] # Afghanistan # Israel # Syria # Iran # Yemen",

The most powerful countries out there are the ones that have the most powerful weapons (i.e. nuclear) and a large enough territory (also called \"strategic depth\").

This is essentially what happened with # Venezuela before, this is exactly what is happening with # Iran today, and it might be something that will happen with # Cuba either tomorrow, in a few days, weeks, months or whenever Trump wants to pull out another adventure for the US military. Russia is now in regression. # Putin 's ambitions in # Ukraine have weakened it and made it regroup, leaving precious \"territories\" behind - this is what happened with # Syria , where the opposition finally got free hand to do whatever they wanted with Bashar Al-Assad, this is what happened in the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh province - where Russia essentially abandoned both Armenia and Azerbaijan, and now it looks like it essentially abandoned Iran - it is true that both Israel and the US had a perfect plan to decapitate # Tehran and made it swiftly, but I did not see any reaction other than diplomatic condemnation (even though there was public information about something since days before); no strong military signals of aligning with Tehran or anything, nothing. Russia simply abandoned it, out of impotence, generated by the war in Ukraine. And it's influence in # CentralAsia albeit still firm in appearance, is shaky as well. As for China, it is way too far from Iran, and it hasn't been historically under its sphere of influence. US is far too, this is why it co-opted Israel for today's blitz operation. There is only one thing that prevents total control by the big-3 of the entire world: state alliances. This could arguably be the decisive factor in deterring # Trump to do a takeover of # Greenland in the same way it did with Venezuela. When # Denmark felt under threat, it asked for help. Nordic countries, Germany, France, all jumped in helping Denmark. The more MAGA friendly countries like # Hungary or those that cannot see there's a divorce going on in the West like # Romania didn't do anything, the latter arguing that it doesn't have troops ready to fight in the Arctic (we do have mountain combat trained units just like the French have, but whatever...), yet it was still enough for Trump to reconsider the borders of his lebensraum. Anyway, moving back to Iran, what was its response after the strike? Well, it conveniently bombed its Muslim neighbors - the worst move it could make. Iran doesn't have many friendly neighbors, but nor does Israel. Iran failed to use diplomacy to its advantage and prevent such an action, or at least provide proper retaliatory measures together with these. If Iran only wanted to strike the US bases, then it just failed miserably. Iran doesn't have the means of precision strikes perfected by the US and the West along the years. It uses weapons the soviets - and then the Russians - made, which are used only for blanket covering of a designated territory. If Iran actually wanted to revenge for the collaboration of these countries with the US, then it was the worst move it could make. I am hopeful that both this and the Greenland episode will be a wake-up call for Europe. Russia is stuck in a grinding war in Donbass, taking away its precious resources and weakening it day by day, and Trump no longer even dreams of getting Greenland - at least for now. But to me, it feels clear that the autocrats in both # Moscow and # DC hate the EU. They hate the idea of countries collaborating for the same goal and staying independent of their sphere of influence - and that's why they're playing the long game. Their goal is to impose friendly leaders through elections and their battlefields are the modern social media platforms and their algorithms. We saw it when # CalinGeorgescu was boosted on TikTok, we saw it when # Elmo got mad that he would have to abide by # EU rules and regulations - and when the White House acted in its support. Any move towards less EU is a move that has the goal of destabilizing the continent, putting it one step closer to the vacuum of power that Russia and the US are more than happy to exploit - just like they did in Venezuela, just like they did in Iran, and just like they will likely do in Cuba in the near future.",

Mientras # Hezbollah en occidente es visto como terroristras, los Kurdos siempre han sido vistos con buenos ojos, y no es casualidad, los primeros son eminentemente antiimperialistas y antisionistas, los segundos, son todo lo contrario. Los kurdos siempre se han aliado con los # yanquis y estos siempre los han puesto a hacer el trabajo sucio para luego venderlos como perros. Ahora comienza una nueva misión de las porquerías kurdas: # Irán El 22 de febrero cinco grupos armados kurdos anunciaron la formación de una coalición político-militar para derrocar a la República Islámica: el Partido de la Vida Libre del Kurdistán, el Partido Democrático del Kurdistán iraní, el Partido Komala del Kurdistán, la Organización de Lucha del Kurdistán iraní y el Partido de la Libertad del Kurdistán. Si tienen presencia en Irán es muy poca y solo el Vida Libre (cuyo parecido político con los kurdos sirios del Rojava es notorio) tiene algo de implantación. Otros dos grupos, uno de ellos una escisión del Komala y la rama kurda del Partido Comunista, no se han unido a esta coalición afirmando que \"carece de cualquier mecanismo ejecutivo y una hoja de ruta clara para la acción práctica\". Pero no se reunieron en Irán, sino en Irak para formar su coalición. Y a quien han recurrido de inmediato para darla a conocer? A representantes mediáticos de isramierda Lo anunciaron 4 hombres y una mujer, a quien uno de esos medios del comemierdismo prosionista le encanta presentar como \"una de las mujeres más buscadas en Irán\". Objetivo? \"Un Irán libre podría nacer de la cooperación entre iraníes e israel. Cuando llegue el momento, atacaremos las bases y centros del régimen. Incluso llegaremos a Teherán\".",

Rafah è stato riaperto solo il mese scorso, consentendo per la prima volta dopo mesi a un numero limitato di palestinesi di lasciare Gaza, tra cui pazienti con urgente bisogno di cure mediche. L'attraversamento è considerato vitale per la consegna degli aiuti umanitari e l'evacuazione dei malati e dei feriti. Tutta la popolazione di Gaza, che conta oltre due milioni di persone, è stata sfollata durante la guerra tra Israele e Hamas e l'enclave continua a dipendere fortemente dagli aiuti umanitari. A metà febbraio le Nazioni Unite hanno dichiarato di aver continuato a incontrare ostacoli nel fornire aiuti salvavita a Gaza. Gaza, Israel closes the Rafah crossing after the bombings in Iran. Israel has closed the Rafah border crossing with Egypt in the context of coordinated Israeli and U.S. attacks against Iran. “Various security measures necessary were implemented, including the closure of border crossings to the Strip until further notice,” a statement said from the Israeli Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories. Rafah had been reopened only last month, allowing for the first time in months a limited number of Palestinians to leave Gaza, including patients in urgent need of medical care. The crossing is considered vital for the delivery of humanitarian aid and the evacuation of the sick and wounded. The entire population of Gaza, which numbers over two million people, has been displaced during the war between Israel and Hamas, and the enclave continues to heavily rely on humanitarian aid. In mid-February, the United Nations stated that it had continued to encounter obstacles in providing life-saving aid to Gaza. # Israel # Egypt # Israeli # Strip # theIsraeli # Territories # Rafah # first # Palestinians # Hamas # theUnitedNations https://www. iltempo.it/esteri/2026/03/01/n ews/gaza-israele-chiude-il-valico-di-rafah-dopo-l-attacco-all-iran-46594623/",

      "text": "Iran is facing a bitter scene; a scene that passed over Afghanistan twenty-five years ago. During the global coalition and American occupation, Iran was among the leading countries that provided good assistance to the West during the occupation. As neighbors, we sincerely regret the current situation in Iran. But \"what's ours is ours;\" meaning, if they had shown compassion and good neighborliness twenty-five years ago, and instead of overthrowing our regime, had at least cooperated with us in intelligence matters as a fellow Muslim country, the situation in the East would not be as it is today. It is clear to everyone the extent of the injustice, oppression, and aggression that the Shiite Safavid clerical regime in Iran has inflicted upon Sunni Muslims worldwide. Twenty years ago, in Iraq, Syria, Yemen, Jordan, and Afghanistan, they exploited opportunities to provide intelligence assistance to Zionists and, through killings, imprisonment, and marginalizing Sunni Muslims from political matters, they created a Shia empire. Later, when Zionists realized that this empire could become a source of trouble for them, they took action, the result of which was the assassination of the leader of this empire. The political situation in Iran is changing, and there is a high probability of an internal crisis emerging, even to the point that there may be no consensus in choosing a new leader. The last opportunity for the late leader's close associates is to attack Israel and America with all their might. If the atmosphere calms down, perhaps the situation they desire will not be repeated. Overall, the assassination of Iran's leader sends the message to the Muslim community that if Muslims do not transcend sectarian and nationalistic demands and do not unite, they will continue to be targeted wherever they are. ایران با آن صحنه تلخی روبه‌رو است؛ صحنه‌ای که بیست‌وپنج سال پیش بر افغانستان گذشت. در دوران ائتلاف جهانی و اشغال آمریکایی، ایران از جمله کشورهای پیشگامی بود که در زمان اشغال به غربی‌ها کمک خوبی کرد. ما به‌عنوان همسایه، از وضعیت کنونی ایران از صمیم قلب متأسف هستیم. اما «هرچه بر ماست از ماست»؛ یعنی اگر آنان ۲۵ سال پیش دلسوزی و حسن همجواری نشان می‌دادند و به‌جای سرنگونی نظام ما، حداقل به‌عنوان یک کشور مسلمان همکاری اطلاعاتی با ما می‌کردند، امروز وضعیت در شرق آن‌گونه که هست، نمی‌بود. این‌که نظام آخوندی صفوی شیعه‌مذهب مستقر در ایران با اهل سنت مسلمانان جهان چه اندازه ظلم، اجحاف و تعدی کرده، بر همه روشن است. آنان بیست سال پیش در عراق، سوریه، یمن، اردن و افغانستان با استفاده از فرصت، به کمک‌های اطلاعاتی صهیونیست‌ها پرداختند و در این کشورها با کشتار، زندانی کردن و دور نگه‌داشتن اهل سنت از مسائل سیاسی، یک امپراتوری شیعی ایجاد کردند. بعدها وقتی صهیونیست‌ها دریافتند که این امپراتوری می‌تواند برای آنان دردسرساز شود، در برابرش اقدام کردند و نتیجه آن امروز به کشته شدن رهبر این امپراتوری انجامید. وضعیت سیاسی در ایران در حال تغییر است و احتمال زیادی وجود دارد که بحران داخلی به‌وجود آید، حتی تا جایی که در تعیین رهبر جدید شاید نظر واحدی شکل نگیرد. آخرین فرصت نزدیکان رهبر کشته‌شده این است که با تمام توان به اسرائیل و آمریکا حمله کنند. اگر فضا آرام شود، شاید وضعیت آن‌گونه که آنان می‌خواهند، دیگر تکرار نشود. در مجموع، کشته شدن رهبر ایران برای امت مسلمان این پیام را دارد که اگر مسلمانان از خواسته‌های فرقه‌ای و ملیتی عبور نکنند و متحد نشوند، همچنان در هرجا هدف قرار خواهند گرفت Source: شهاب لېوال Shahab lewal313 (@Shahablewal313) [ https:// x.com/Shahablewal313/status/20 28011844858749416 ] # Afghanistan # Israel # Syria # Iran # Yemen",

During the era of the international coalition and American occupation, Iran was one of the leading countries that provided significant assistance to the West. As neighbors, we are deeply saddened by Iran's current situation. However, (as the saying goes) if they had demonstrated brotherhood and good neighborliness 25 years ago, instead of destroying our system, they would have at least provided intelligence support to us. Today, the situation in the East would not be as it is. It is well-known to all the injustices, oppression, and transgressions that the Shiite Safavid regime in Iran has committed against Sunni Muslims worldwide. Twenty years ago, they provided intelligence support to Zionists in Iraq, Syria, Yemen, Jordan, and Afghanistan, taking advantage of the opportunity to imprison and marginalize Sunni Muslims from political issues while building a Shiite empire in those regions. Later, when Zionists realized that this empire could pose a threat to them, they began efforts to undermine it, culminating today in the assassination of its leader. The political situation in Iran is changing, and there is a strong possibility of domestic turmoil, perhaps even to the point where a unified ideology may not emerge in the election of a new leader. The last chance for the late leader's close associates is to launch a full-scale attack on Israel and America. If the situation cools down, it might not be as they desire.

Los rebeldes hutíes de Yemen decidieron volver a lanzar ataques con misiles y drones contra las rutas de navegación en la región y contra Israel, en apoyo a # Irán tras la nueva agresión perpetrada este sábado contra la República Islámica, reportan # AP y # Reuters citando a dos altos funcionarios hutíes anónimos. Una de las fuentes señaló que las fuerzas del movimiento podrían llevar a cabo su primer ataque \"esta misma noche\". Por su parte, el Consejo Político Supremo del movimiento rebelde \"condenó y denunció en los términos más enérgicos la traicionera y criminal agresión estadounidense-israelí\" contra el país persa. \"Verdadera naturaleza de dos potencias agresoras\" En un comunicado, recogido por la agencia yemení Saba, el organismo afirmó que \"esta flagrante agresión constituye un crimen mayor plenamente consumado, una violación flagrante de la soberanía de un Estado independiente y una escandalosa ruptura con las leyes y las cartas internacionales\", que revela \"la verdadera naturaleza de EE.UU. y de la entidad israelí como dos potencias agresoras que no respetan las leyes ni los valores humanitarios\". Ante esta situación, el consejo expresó su plena solidaridad con # Teherán y reiteró \"su derecho legítimo a defender su soberanía y su seguridad\". Además, indicó que EE.UU. e Israel son \"plenamente responsables\" de las consecuencias que \"esta peligrosa escalada\" pueda tener sobre la seguridad y la estabilidad de la región https:// t.me/Eurekapress/51194",

I don't understand the people condemning it, I don't understand how they think and what they want, and I'm assuming it's just about hating Israel.

Peaceful protests by Iranians expressing legitimate grievances have once again been hijacked . Violent riots are being encouraged and enabled by foreign-backed actors immune to their consequences. They threaten the safety and security of every Iranian and cause costly damage to public infrastructure and an economy already suffering from crushing sanctions. The genocidal Israeli regime killed 1,200 Iranian civilians in June. Those who stood silent and even cheered on these killings now claim to act in defense of Iranians as they call for even more attacks on Iran . Afghanistan, Syria, Libya, Lebanon, Iraq, and scores of other countries, most recently Venezuela , attest to the consistent outcome of foreign interference: chaos, instability, destruction, and immeasurable suffering. Foreign-backed riots in 1953 changed the course of our nation’s trajectory. Let’s not be doomed by repeating tragic history. No one can trick us into welcoming attacks on Iran. Long live Iran, Iranians, and Iranian sovereignty! پاینده باد ایران زمین The r/Iran moderation team &#32; submitted by &#32; /u/AutoModerator [link] &#32; [comments]",

The gap between births and deaths is the reason for the increase in population. High birth rates in the 1960s and family planning policies suspended after the revolution make it distinct from other nations. Iran, especially Tehran, has some of the worst water shortages in the world and I've heard reports that Tehran may need to be evacuated if the water shortage gets worse. The population size is simply unsustainable for its resources. It seems that population increase is the main driver for the water shortage. Also housing strain, pressures on schools and jobs, air pollution and congestion. How much do Iranians / Persians feel the population increase and knock on effects is to blame for the current problems? &#32; submitted by &#32; /u/atreeon [link] &#32; [comments]",

      "title": "I analyzed 20,802 Lebanese job postings from Telegram to map our job market, brain drain, and Gulf recruitment patterns. The findings are eye-opening",
      "text": "I spent the past few weeks scraping and analyzing over 20,800 job postings from the subreddit's Job Vacancy Telegram channel. The goal was simple: understand what Lebanon's job market actually looks like right now, what skills are in demand, and what kind of Lebanese talent Gulf countries are specifically hunting for. Here's what the data shows. Charts attached at the bottom. 📊 The Dataset at a Glance 20,802 total job postings analyzed 7,159 local Lebanon-based jobs 1,100 Gulf-based jobs actively targeting Lebanese talent 562 jobs offering USD salary (~2.7% of all posts) 220 remote/work-from-Lebanon positions 🧠 Most In-Demand Skills (See chart: Top Skills in Demand) Ignoring a likely data artifact at the top of the chart*, the real skill demand story is clear: Technical skills dominating: Public Relations / Communications (13,389 mentions) SAP enterprise software (2,452) Java (2,264), English proficiency (2,343) Excel (2,411), Sales (2,649) JavaScript (1,506), Python (1,140), React (1,128), SQL (1,102) Git (1,361), AWS (1,003), ERP systems (1,059) What this tells us: Lebanon's job market has bifurcated into two dominant demand clusters. Enterprise business operations (SAP, ERP, Excel, finance) and modern software development (Python, JavaScript, React, cloud). Both reflect sectors that can generate foreign currency, which is no accident in a post-crisis economy. The strong demand for English (2,343) over Arabic (907) is a significant signal,, many roles are internationally oriented or targeting Gulf markets where English is the business language. *Note: &quot;R (programming)&quot; appears first with 20,000+ matches due to the single letter &quot;r&quot; matching inside other words. A known limitation of keyword-based extraction on short text. 🎓 Most Requested Academic Backgrounds (See chart: Top Majors in Demand) IT — dominates at 15,123 mentions (nearly 4x the second place) HR — 4,377 (surprising, reflects organizational need) Computer Science — 3,417 Management — 2,121 Media — 1,658 Marketing — 1,492 Graphic Design — 912 The gap between IT (15k) and everything else is enormous. Lebanese employers and Gulf recruiters are overwhelmingly seeking tech-literate graduates. Architecture (338), Law (216), and Education (491) rank very low, not because they're unimportant, but because the market isn't creating new jobs in those fields at anywhere near the same rate. Takeaway for students: If you're choosing a major right now, the market data is screaming IT, CS, HR, and digital media. 🏭 Industries Hiring Most (See chart: Top Industries) IT -- 15,123 (by far the leader) PR / Communications --13,389 Development -- 5,533 Software -- 3,042 Media -- 1,658 Then a long tail: Retail (633), Training (630), NGO (474), Insurance (478), Medical (452), Hospital (430), Finance (423), Education (491), Hospitality (316). The Finance sector's surprisingly low ranking (423) is notable, Lebanon used to export banking talent across the entire Arab world. The near-collapse of the banking sector post-2019 is written directly into this chart. 🌍 Gulf Cities Recruiting Lebanese Talent (See chart: Top Gulf Cities Hiring Lebanese Talent) Here's where it gets interesting. The rankings might surprise you: KSA / Saudi Arabia — 211+131+114+26 = ~482 combined mentions (LARGEST recruiter) Kuwait — 205+4 = ~209 mentions Dubai / UAE — 197+173+41+41 = ~452 combined mentions Qatar — 128+36 = ~164 mentions Oman — 112+6 = ~118 mentions Bahrain — ~10 mentions Saudi Arabia edges out the UAE as the top recruiter of Lebanese talent. This likely reflects Vision 2030's massive demand for skilled Arab professionals across tech, finance, and consulting. Kuwait's strong showing is also underappreciated, it rarely gets discussed in the brain drain conversation but is clearly very active. The 1,100 Gulf jobs represent only 5.3% of total postings but they carry enormous weight because they're almost universally offering stable foreign currency salaries. 📍 Lebanese Cities with Most Job Activity (See chart: Top Lebanese Cities with Job Posts) Beirut -- 2,507 (still the undisputed center) Sour/Tyre -- 1,154 (This is most likely inflated by keyword matching, &quot;sour&quot; appears in other contexts) Sin el Fil -- 311 Dbayeh -- 289 Jbeil -- 232, Antelias -- 225, Zalka -- 221, Jounieh -- 219 The Mount Lebanon coastal corridor (Sin el Fil → Dbayeh → Antelias → Zalka → Jounieh) is clearly the secondary economic belt after Beirut. Tripoli (131) and Bekaa (121) show some activity but lag significantly, confirming the persistent geographic inequality in economic opportunity. 💵 The USD Salary Crisis. The Most Important Number Only 562 out of 20,802 postings — 2.7% — explicitly offer USD salaries. Let that sink in. With the lira sitting at 89,000+ to the dollar and having lost ~98% of its value since 2019, the vast majority of local jobs still denominate salaries in a currency that is functionally worthless for savings, planning, or covering import-dependent expenses. A USD salary in Lebanon today isn't a perk. It's the difference between being able to afford basic food and medicine or not. Which industries offer USD pay? Almost exclusively: IT companies serving international clients NGOs and international organizations PR firms with international accounts High-end hospitality catering to foreign visitors The scarcity of USD jobs locally is, in my view, the single biggest driver of brain drain, more so than Gulf recruitment itself. Gulf recruiters aren't stealing Lebanese talent. They're simply offering what Lebanon stopped being able to provide: a stable income. 💻 Remote Work, A Missed Opportunity Only 220 remote positions were detected (1.1% of all posts). This is genuinely low, though part of this is definitely a data limitation, international companies hiring Lebanese remotely tend to post on LinkedIn or international platforms, not local Telegram channels. But the underlying reality is that Lebanon should be a remote work paradise on paper: highly educated, trilingual, tech-savvy talent at a fraction of Western labor costs. The infrastructure problems (electricity, internet reliability) are the main barrier. Fix those (way easier said than done I know) and Lebanon could theoretically retain its best talent while still earning foreign currency, the best of both worlds. 📌 Key Takeaways If you're a Lebanese job seeker: Learn Python, JavaScript, SAP, or cloud skills (AWS). Prioritize English. Target IT, software, and digital marketing roles. If staying in Lebanon, make USD compensation non-negotiable. If you're a Lebanese student choosing a major: The market data is unambiguous, IT and Computer Science have 4-5x the demand of the next closest field. HR and Management are solid second choices. The big picture: Lebanon has functionally become a talent incubator for the Gulf. We train some of the best professionals in the Arab world, in trilingual, internationally-oriented universities and then watch them leave because we can't offer a stable currency to pay them in. The brain drain isn't a social problem. It's a macroeconomic arithmetic problem. And 2.7% USD salaries is the equation. ‼️‼️Methodology note: Data extracted via Python keyword-matching on 20,802 Telegram job posts. Limitations include false positives from short keywords (single letters, common words) and undercounting of roles not explicitly labeled with keywords. Results are therefore inflated to some degree. Happy to answer questions or do deeper breakdowns by sector. Top skills in demand. 20,802 Lebanese Telegram job postings. Note: \\&quot;R\\&quot; at top is a data artifact from single-letter keyword matching Most requested academic backgrounds. IT dominates at 15k+. Nearly 4x the next field (human resources) Industries hiring most. Note Finance's surprisingly low rank, Lebanon's banking sector collapse is basically visible in this chart.. Gulf cities recruiting Lebanese talent. Saudi Arabia edges out UAE as the #1 recruiter, surprising given popular perception. Lebanese cities by job posting volume. The Mount Lebanon coastal corridor is the secondary economic belt. Note that sour is very likely an inflated number. &#32; submitted by &#32; /u/Gepoo13 [link] &#32; [comments]",

      "text": "Aden Before the spread of modern media, the methods for sighting the crescent moon of Ramadan relied on old oral traditions. In Aden, the process was carried out in traditional ways similar to other Islamic cities. Trusted religious figures would climb to high places in the mountains or go out toward the sea to ensure a clear view of the horizon. “Al-Bomba” in the area of Sirah was a well-known location. A point near the sea was chosen because of its clear horizon, making it suitable for sighting the crescent. Once the moon was confirmed, the musaharati (the pre-dawn caller) would be informed to announce the beginning of Ramadan, as declared by respected sheikhs. Supplications and Ramadan chants would then fill the mosques, creating a deeply spiritual atmosphere across the city. This was a common tradition in many Islamic cities before modern media existed. In the past, before radio and television, the musaharati played an important role in waking people in Aden for the pre-dawn meal (suhoor). People used to sleep early and did not stay up late as many do today watching television or spending time in markets. Like many Arab and Islamic cities, Aden had inherited Ramadan traditions, and the musaharati was part of its cultural and social fabric. He would walk through the old neighborhoods of Aden using a drum or tambourine, sometimes accompanied by a chanter who recited religious hymns and supplications. He often called out the names of well-known residents, adding a personal and warm touch to the tradition. During the period of British rule in Aden, local customs were influenced by modern urban life. However, the musaharati remained present in some popular neighborhoods. After the rise of radio and television, his role gradually declined. Religious programs and Ramadan chants were broadcast, and people began relying more on these modern means. Later, the Crescent and Holidays Committee affiliated with the municipality announced such occasions through radio and television. Despite this decline, the memory of the musaharati remains deeply rooted in the hearts of many Aden residents, symbolizing warmth, unity, and the communal spirit of Ramadan nights. As for the Ramadan cannon in Aden, its history dates back to before the British occupation. It was used to announce the time of breaking the fast and the time of imsak (beginning of fasting). The Ramadan cannon continued to be used even after independence. It helped organize fasting times through a loud and widely heard signal, reaching surrounding areas. The cannon was fired twice daily: At sunset to signal iftar (breaking the fast). At dawn to signal imsak (start of fasting). Three cannons were installed in elevated areas of Aden, including Jebel Hadid to ensure the sound reached across the city and nearby districts such as Khor Maksar, Al Mansoura, and Sheikh Othman. Before that, there had been an old cannon on Jebel Ma'ashiq, another in the Tawahi area (Al-Banjasar), and one on Jebel Al Qalua. After independence in 1967, the Ramadan cannon tradition continued for a short period but gradually declined with the spread of modern media and technology, which made it easier to determine prayer and fasting times accurately. &#32; submitted by &#32; /u/alihedgehog73839 [link] &#32; [comments]",

Children took part by singing and welcoming the arrival of the holy month of Ramadan. On the 21st of Sha‘ban, both adults and children in Al-Qadi quarter celebrated the occasion. The event was broadcast live on social media platforms, spreading joy among people despite the difficult circumstances the country is going through due to war and the economic collapse that has heavily affected citizens’ livelihoods. Young girls wore colorful makhawer (traditional dresses) in various designs, a garment traditionally worn by women during Ramadan as part of local custom. The children wore small ma‘awiz (wrap skirts), shamzan (the well-known Adeni vest), and shirts, carrying lanterns of different sizes that added to the festive Ramadan spirit. Oud player Ayman Murad said, “It was a beautiful day. I was truly happy to be a reason for bringing joy to the hearts of my people and the children. I am proud to sing for Al-Qadi quarter and its kind residents. Thanks to everyone who contributed to the success of this Sha‘baniyah evening, which was widely appreciated.” Munther Mohammed stated that Al-Qadi quarter is a proud example for all neighborhoods of Crater and is always at the forefront in reviving such old religious traditions of our beloved city of Aden. Diaa Sarouri wrote on a video of the Sha‘baniyah that he shared, “Al-Qadi quarter was different last night.” He mentioned that he watched a live broadcast on Facebook and praised the revival of popular heritage among children. Many social media posts expressed that it is beautiful to revive these Adeni traditions and bring joy to children’s hearts, calling for the continuation of such occasions and old customs to keep them alive once again. &#32; submitted by &#32; /u/alihedgehog73839 [link] &#32; [comments]",

      "text": "TLDR is at the bottom of the post. This post may seem random; however, I must get some things off my chest that have been on my mind for so long. I must ask, do any Yemenis, yourself or people you know, have dysfunctional families and horrible relatives? All throughout my life, from what I've seen, I feel like I am the only Yemeni in my city who deals with this. For some context, my father is from Ibb and my mother from Taiz. I grew up in NYC with my mother and her family because my parents are divorced. I love both my parents, and I love my mother's side of my family; however, their behavior over the years has infuriated me. The problem with them is that they seem to let everything and anything slide without speaking up. Both old friends and their own relatives have betrayed them over the years. But when they bump into these old friends, or they visit/call their relatives, they're nothing but smiles and never mention what they did. The first and worst betrayal comes from a family that was once close friends of my family. I will refer to them as &quot;the fakes&quot;. I can't be too detailed in case someone who knows me sees this post, but my neighborhood has a large number of Middle Eastern stores and restaurants, so it's not hard to find it. For context, the majority of the Yemeni's in my neighborhood (at least those I see/know), come from Ibb, Aden, and Taiz. When I was in high school, I also met and knew people from Yafa, Radaa, and Ibb. A majority of both my neighborhoods, Yemeni's from Ibb and the NY Yemeni's in general, come from a village called &quot;Sharih&quot; and the areas surrounding it. When 'the fakes&quot; first came to America, they decided to change their name to a new one instead of their original one. The name they chose is very similar to that of my mother's family, but I cannot say it in case someone I know reads this post. They were actually my family's neighbors in our old neighborhood in the east of Brooklyn. They got along very well before they moved to where we live now. When they moved to our current neighborhood, the Yemeni's they would meet would ask them if they were from my family's Usra/Tribe, which is large and well known. Upon learning about this, they lied and stuck with it. They began to call us less often. When my family moved to the neighborhood, people would be confused when they would explain that it was us who belonged to our tribe and not the fakes. Some of the people from their family have admitted that we are the real members of our Usra, but not all of them. Along with that, our family is no better. Many years ago, my mother's cousins spread lies about my mother and her siblings, saying that they cause trouble and gossip (ironic), and this caused my great aunts to call less often, which further divided the family. These extended relatives, at least the women, seem never to call, and they didn't even come to the funeral of one of our great aunts. My father's side is no better. They sold his store in NY behind his back, and convinced him to divorce my mother for someone from their village. My father's siblings convinced him to leave my mother for one of their sisters-in-law. He divorced his 2nd wife soon after and has regretted his decision ever since. There are also random people who just hate my family, even though we did nothing to them. Over 10 years ago, one of my aunts got a call from the hospital, and she was told that they caught one of their employees looking through her medical records and other patients' records. They asked if she wanted her to be reprimanded, and she said yes. That employee happened to be Yemeni, and she happens to be friends with &quot;the fakes&quot; as well. What are the odds lol? I was in the grocery store with my mom last month, and she told me to wait outside because there was a woman there she didn't want to see me. Later, she told me she used to be friends with her siblings and would even sleep over sometimes, but they cut us off and stopped contacting us. Guess who she's friends with? THE FAKES! I could go on and on, but I'll stop here. If I shared any more details, my family members or the people I mentioned may make a big deal out of it. Has anyone else here dealt with horrible people in the Yemeni community and wider diaspora? What about terrible relatives? I constantly wonder, what happened to people's Adab? Why betray your friends and family members when they did nothing to you? I always see everyone else in the NYC community with their siblings, cousins, and other family members, running successful businesses. Driving nice cars. Going to each other's weddings. I deleted Instagram because I feel mildly depressed just watching every other Yemeni I know enjoying the things I don't have in my life. But I guess this is just Allah's way of testing me. I also apologize for how long this post is; it took me more than a week to finish it, as this topic stresses me out greatly. Anyway, Ramadan Mubarak! TLDR: My mother's side of my family is envious, divided, and doesn't care much about each other. My dad's side is no better for different reasons. Ex-friends stole our last name, gossiped, and betrayed us. It feels like no one else in the Yemeni community deals with this stuff, and my family is the exception. Have you dealt with our heard of anything similar to this? &#32; submitted by &#32; /u/FuzzyTurtle856 [link] &#32; [comments]",
