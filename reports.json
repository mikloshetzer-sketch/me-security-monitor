      "text": "An analysis on Al Jazeera argues that the assassination of Ali Khamenei is unlikely to trigger the rapid collapse of Iran’s political system that Washington hopes for. Instead, it may push the country toward a far more dangerous and uncompromising phase of war. While Trump portrayed the assassination as a decisive blow that could topple the government, analysts say Iran’s power structure was designed to withstand precisely this kind of shock. The system is institutional, not purely personal. Mechanisms for succession were quickly activated, including plans for an interim leadership council. Iran’s dual military framework, the regular army and the IRGC, backed by the Basij militia, remains intact, cohesive and deeply embedded in the state. Rather than collapse, experts warn of transformation. With Khamenei gone, the doctrine of “strategic patience” that often restrained Iran’s responses may also be gone. Analysts suggest a new leadership, particularly one shaped more directly by military figures, could abandon caution in favor of a “scorched earth” approach: escalating retaliation, widening the battlefield, and removing previous political red lines. Killing Iran’s “head” does not mean the system will collapse. Instead, a cornered and militarized leadership may escalate outward, making wider war, not regime implosion, the greater risk. # Israel # Palestine # Gaza # Iran # Trump",

Mientras # Hezbollah en occidente es visto como terroristras, los Kurdos siempre han sido vistos con buenos ojos, y no es casualidad, los primeros son eminentemente antiimperialistas y antisionistas, los segundos, son todo lo contrario. Los kurdos siempre se han aliado con los # yanquis y estos siempre los han puesto a hacer el trabajo sucio para luego venderlos como perros. Ahora comienza una nueva misión de las porquerías kurdas: # Irán El 22 de febrero cinco grupos armados kurdos anunciaron la formación de una coalición político-militar para derrocar a la República Islámica: el Partido de la Vida Libre del Kurdistán, el Partido Democrático del Kurdistán iraní, el Partido Komala del Kurdistán, la Organización de Lucha del Kurdistán iraní y el Partido de la Libertad del Kurdistán. Si tienen presencia en Irán es muy poca y solo el Vida Libre (cuyo parecido político con los kurdos sirios del Rojava es notorio) tiene algo de implantación. Otros dos grupos, uno de ellos una escisión del Komala y la rama kurda del Partido Comunista, no se han unido a esta coalición afirmando que \"carece de cualquier mecanismo ejecutivo y una hoja de ruta clara para la acción práctica\". Pero no se reunieron en Irán, sino en Irak para formar su coalición. Y a quien han recurrido de inmediato para darla a conocer? A representantes mediáticos de isramierda Lo anunciaron 4 hombres y una mujer, a quien uno de esos medios del comemierdismo prosionista le encanta presentar como \"una de las mujeres más buscadas en Irán\". Objetivo? \"Un Irán libre podría nacer de la cooperación entre iraníes e israel. Cuando llegue el momento, atacaremos las bases y centros del régimen. Incluso llegaremos a Teherán\".",

      "text": "Il Tempo: Gaza, Israele chiude il valico di Rafah dopo i bombardamenti in Iran Israele ha chiuso il valico di frontiera di Rafah a Gaza con l'Egitto, nel contesto degli attacchi congiunti israeliani e statunitensi contro l'Iran. \"Sono state implementate diverse misure di sicurezza necessarie, tra cui la chiusura dei valichi di frontiera verso la Striscia fino a nuovo avviso\", ha affermato in una nota il Coordinatore israeliano delle attività governative nei Territori occupati. Rafah è stato riaperto solo il mese scorso, consentendo per la prima volta dopo mesi a un numero limitato di palestinesi di lasciare Gaza, tra cui pazienti con urgente bisogno di cure mediche. L'attraversamento è considerato vitale per la consegna degli aiuti umanitari e l'evacuazione dei malati e dei feriti. Tutta la popolazione di Gaza, che conta oltre due milioni di persone, è stata sfollata durante la guerra tra Israele e Hamas e l'enclave continua a dipendere fortemente dagli aiuti umanitari. A metà febbraio le Nazioni Unite hanno dichiarato di aver continuato a incontrare ostacoli nel fornire aiuti salvavita a Gaza. Gaza, Israel closes the Rafah crossing after the bombings in Iran. Israel has closed the Rafah border crossing with Egypt in the context of coordinated Israeli and U.S. attacks against Iran. “Various security measures necessary were implemented, including the closure of border crossings to the Strip until further notice,” a statement said from the Israeli Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories. Rafah had been reopened only last month, allowing for the first time in months a limited number of Palestinians to leave Gaza, including patients in urgent need of medical care. The crossing is considered vital for the delivery of humanitarian aid and the evacuation of the sick and wounded. The entire population of Gaza, which numbers over two million people, has been displaced during the war between Israel and Hamas, and the enclave continues to heavily rely on humanitarian aid. In mid-February, the United Nations stated that it had continued to encounter obstacles in providing life-saving aid to Gaza. # Israel # Egypt # Israeli # Strip # theIsraeli # Territories # Rafah # first # Palestinians # Hamas # theUnitedNations https://www. iltempo.it/esteri/2026/03/01/n ews/gaza-israele-chiude-il-valico-di-rafah-dopo-l-attacco-all-iran-46594623/",

L'amministrazione statunitense e Israele \"hanno la piena responsabilità di questa palese aggressione e di questo crimine atroce contro la sovranità della Repubblica islamica dell'Iran, e delle sue gravi ripercussioni sulla sicurezza e la stabilità della regione\", ha affermato Hamas sui social network, sottolineando che i paesi arabi e musulmani hanno la “responsabilità politica, legale e storica di adottare misure immediate e decisive\". Iran, Hamas mourns Khamenei and reveals: “He gave us political and military support.” Hamas mourns Ali Khamenei and condemns the “atrocious” attack by the United States and Israel. The Palestinian group says it is in mourning for the death of Iran’s Supreme Leader, which it called an “atrocious” attack by the United States and Israel. “It has provided every form of political, diplomatic, and military support to our people, our cause, and our resistance,” Hamas said in a statement. The United States administration and Israel “bear full responsibility for this blatant aggression and this atrocious crime against the sovereignty of the Islamic Republic of Iran, and its serious repercussions on the security and stability of the region,” Hamas said on social networks, emphasizing that Arab and Muslim countries have the “political, legal, and historical responsibility to take immediate and decisive measures.” # Hamas # Khamenei # AliKhamenei # theUnitedStates # Israel # Palestinian # SupremeLeader # UnitedStates # Muslim https://www. iltempo.it/esteri/2026/03/01/n ews/iran-hamas-piage-khamenei-e-rivela-ci-ha-dato-sostegno-politico-e-militare--46594404/",

      "text": "Iran is facing a bitter scene; a scene that passed over Afghanistan twenty-five years ago. During the global coalition and American occupation, Iran was among the leading countries that provided good assistance to the West during the occupation. As neighbors, we sincerely regret the current situation in Iran. But \"what's ours is ours;\" meaning, if they had shown compassion and good neighborliness twenty-five years ago, and instead of overthrowing our regime, had at least cooperated with us in intelligence matters as a fellow Muslim country, the situation in the East would not be as it is today. It is clear to everyone the extent of the injustice, oppression, and aggression that the Shiite Safavid clerical regime in Iran has inflicted upon Sunni Muslims worldwide. Twenty years ago, in Iraq, Syria, Yemen, Jordan, and Afghanistan, they exploited opportunities to provide intelligence assistance to Zionists and, through killings, imprisonment, and marginalizing Sunni Muslims from political matters, they created a Shia empire. Later, when Zionists realized that this empire could become a source of trouble for them, they took action, the result of which was the assassination of the leader of this empire. The political situation in Iran is changing, and there is a high probability of an internal crisis emerging, even to the point that there may be no consensus in choosing a new leader. The last opportunity for the late leader's close associates is to attack Israel and America with all their might. If the atmosphere calms down, perhaps the situation they desire will not be repeated. Overall, the assassination of Iran's leader sends the message to the Muslim community that if Muslims do not transcend sectarian and nationalistic demands and do not unite, they will continue to be targeted wherever they are. ایران با آن صحنه تلخی روبه‌رو است؛ صحنه‌ای که بیست‌وپنج سال پیش بر افغانستان گذشت. در دوران ائتلاف جهانی و اشغال آمریکایی، ایران از جمله کشورهای پیشگامی بود که در زمان اشغال به غربی‌ها کمک خوبی کرد. ما به‌عنوان همسایه، از وضعیت کنونی ایران از صمیم قلب متأسف هستیم. اما «هرچه بر ماست از ماست»؛ یعنی اگر آنان ۲۵ سال پیش دلسوزی و حسن همجواری نشان می‌دادند و به‌جای سرنگونی نظام ما، حداقل به‌عنوان یک کشور مسلمان همکاری اطلاعاتی با ما می‌کردند، امروز وضعیت در شرق آن‌گونه که هست، نمی‌بود. این‌که نظام آخوندی صفوی شیعه‌مذهب مستقر در ایران با اهل سنت مسلمانان جهان چه اندازه ظلم، اجحاف و تعدی کرده، بر همه روشن است. آنان بیست سال پیش در عراق، سوریه، یمن، اردن و افغانستان با استفاده از فرصت، به کمک‌های اطلاعاتی صهیونیست‌ها پرداختند و در این کشورها با کشتار، زندانی کردن و دور نگه‌داشتن اهل سنت از مسائل سیاسی، یک امپراتوری شیعی ایجاد کردند. بعدها وقتی صهیونیست‌ها دریافتند که این امپراتوری می‌تواند برای آنان دردسرساز شود، در برابرش اقدام کردند و نتیجه آن امروز به کشته شدن رهبر این امپراتوری انجامید. وضعیت سیاسی در ایران در حال تغییر است و احتمال زیادی وجود دارد که بحران داخلی به‌وجود آید، حتی تا جایی که در تعیین رهبر جدید شاید نظر واحدی شکل نگیرد. آخرین فرصت نزدیکان رهبر کشته‌شده این است که با تمام توان به اسرائیل و آمریکا حمله کنند. اگر فضا آرام شود، شاید وضعیت آن‌گونه که آنان می‌خواهند، دیگر تکرار نشود. در مجموع، کشته شدن رهبر ایران برای امت مسلمان این پیام را دارد که اگر مسلمانان از خواسته‌های فرقه‌ای و ملیتی عبور نکنند و متحد نشوند، همچنان در هرجا هدف قرار خواهند گرفت Source: شهاب لېوال Shahab lewal313 (@Shahablewal313) [ https:// x.com/Shahablewal313/status/20 28011844858749416 ] # Afghanistan # Israel # Syria # Iran # Yemen",

However, (as the saying goes) if they had demonstrated brotherhood and good neighborliness 25 years ago, instead of destroying our system, they would have at least provided intelligence support to us. Today, the situation in the East would not be as it is. It is well-known to all the injustices, oppression, and transgressions that the Shiite Safavid regime in Iran has committed against Sunni Muslims worldwide. Twenty years ago, they provided intelligence support to Zionists in Iraq, Syria, Yemen, Jordan, and Afghanistan, taking advantage of the opportunity to imprison and marginalize Sunni Muslims from political issues while building a Shiite empire in those regions. Later, when Zionists realized that this empire could pose a threat to them, they began efforts to undermine it, culminating today in the assassination of its leader. The political situation in Iran is changing, and there is a strong possibility of domestic turmoil, perhaps even to the point where a unified ideology may not emerge in the election of a new leader. The last chance for the late leader's close associates is to launch a full-scale attack on Israel and America. If the situation cools down, it might not be as they desire. Overall, the assassination of Iran's leader demonstrates to the Muslim community that if Muslims do not transcend sectarian and national demands and unite, they will be targeted everywhere. ایران باندې هغه ترخه صحنه راتلونکې ده ؛ کومه چې له نن ۲۵ کاله مخکې پر افغانستان راغله. د نړیوال ائتلاف او امریکایي اشغال په دوران کې ایران د هغه مخکښو هیوادونو څخه وه چې ،د امریکایي اشغال په دوران کې یې غربیانو ته ښه مرسته کړې وه. موږ منحیث دې ګاونډي د ایران نني وضعیت باندې له زړه خواشیني یوو. خو (هرچې برماست ازماست)یعنې که دوي ۲۵ کاله مخکې خواخوږی او ښه ګاوډیتوب استازولی کړې وای ، زموږ د نظام د نسکورولو پر ځای ېې د مسلمان هیواد په حیث حداقل استخباراتي مرسته راسره کړې وای ، نن به شرق کې وضعیت داسې نه وه لکه چې ده . دا چې ایران کې میشت آخندي صفوي شعیه مذهبه نظام د ټولې نړۍ له اهل سنت مسلمانانو سره څومره غبن، ظلم او تیرۍ کړی دا خو ټولو ته جوته ده. دوي له نن شل کاله مخکې عراق ، سوریه، یمن ، اردن او افغانستان کې د صهیونیستان استخباراتي مرسته وکړه او له فرصته په استفادې یې د اهل سنت مسلمانانو وژنه زندانې کول او له سیاسي مسایلو لرې ساتلو سره یې یادوهیوادو کې یې شعیه امپراطوری جوړه کړه . وروسته کله چې صهیونیستان وپوهیدل چې ، دا امپراطورۍ دوي ته سرخوږۍ جوړوی شي ، بل مقابل یې هڅې پیل کړې. او پایله یې نن ددې امپراطورۍ د رهبر په وژنه تمامه شوه. ایران کې سیاسي وضعیت بدلون مومي ډیر احتمال شته چې کورنی کړکیچ رامنځ ته شي آن تر دې چې د نوي رهبر په ټاکنه کې شاید واحده نظریه رامنځته نشي. د وژل شوي رهبر نږدې خلکو وروستی چانس دادی چې په ټول توان اسرائیل او امریکا باندې برید وکړي . که صحنه سړه شوه وضعیت شاید هغه شان نوي چې دوی بیا غواړي . په ټوله کې د ایران د رهبر وژنه مسلمه امت ته دا څرګندوي چې ، که مسلمانان له مذهبي فرقه ای او ملیتي غوښتنو تیر نشي سره متحد نشي همداسې به هرځای کې په نښه کیږي.

Una de las fuentes señaló que las fuerzas del movimiento podrían llevar a cabo su primer ataque \"esta misma noche\". Por su parte, el Consejo Político Supremo del movimiento rebelde \"condenó y denunció en los términos más enérgicos la traicionera y criminal agresión estadounidense-israelí\" contra el país persa. \"Verdadera naturaleza de dos potencias agresoras\" En un comunicado, recogido por la agencia yemení Saba, el organismo afirmó que \"esta flagrante agresión constituye un crimen mayor plenamente consumado, una violación flagrante de la soberanía de un Estado independiente y una escandalosa ruptura con las leyes y las cartas internacionales\", que revela \"la verdadera naturaleza de EE.UU. y de la entidad israelí como dos potencias agresoras que no respetan las leyes ni los valores humanitarios\". Ante esta situación, el consejo expresó su plena solidaridad con # Teherán y reiteró \"su derecho legítimo a defender su soberanía y su seguridad\".

I am on YouTube watching the live cams in Israel and hear the sirens go off, and see the missiles coming. This has been nonstop naturally. Don't some of you all just stay in a bomb shelter with the exception of going to the store, going to shower etc. ?? And are there decked bombs shelters that have bathrooms? And if a building is hit and collapses and you all are underneath isnt that scary or are bomb shelters not underneath the structures? And I would be afraid of getting in the shower, washing my hair and have a siren go off. The anxiety has to be crazy. If a tourist visits Israel, does the hotel advise them where the closest shelters is and is it wise to ask just in case? Thank you &#32; submitted by &#32; /u/AZShitshow [link] &#32; [comments]",

Peaceful protests by Iranians expressing legitimate grievances have once again been hijacked . Violent riots are being encouraged and enabled by foreign-backed actors immune to their consequences. They threaten the safety and security of every Iranian and cause costly damage to public infrastructure and an economy already suffering from crushing sanctions. The genocidal Israeli regime killed 1,200 Iranian civilians in June. Those who stood silent and even cheered on these killings now claim to act in defense of Iranians as they call for even more attacks on Iran . Afghanistan, Syria, Libya, Lebanon, Iraq, and scores of other countries, most recently Venezuela , attest to the consistent outcome of foreign interference: chaos, instability, destruction, and immeasurable suffering. Foreign-backed riots in 1953 changed the course of our nation’s trajectory. Let’s not be doomed by repeating tragic history. No one can trick us into welcoming attacks on Iran.

      "title": "I analyzed 20,802 Lebanese job postings from Telegram to map our job market, brain drain, and Gulf recruitment patterns. The findings are eye-opening",
      "text": "I spent the past few weeks scraping and analyzing over 20,800 job postings from the subreddit's Job Vacancy Telegram channel. The goal was simple: understand what Lebanon's job market actually looks like right now, what skills are in demand, and what kind of Lebanese talent Gulf countries are specifically hunting for. Here's what the data shows. Charts attached at the bottom. 📊 The Dataset at a Glance 20,802 total job postings analyzed 6,463 local Lebanon-based jobs 1,100 Gulf-based jobs actively targeting Lebanese talent 562 jobs offering USD salary (~2.7% of all posts) 220 remote/work-from-Lebanon positions 🧠 Most In-Demand Skills (See chart below: Top Skills in Demand) Communication leads at 3,245 mentions, followed by Sales (2,649), Excel (2,496), SAP (2,452), and English proficiency (2,343). On the tech side: Java (2,264), JavaScript (1,506), Python (1,140), React (1,128), SQL (1,102), Git (1,361), AWS (1,003). Lebanon's job market has bifurcated into two dominant demand clusters. Enterprise business operations (SAP, ERP, Excel) and modern software development (Python, JavaScript, React, cloud). Both reflect sectors that can generate foreign currency, which is no accident in a post-crisis economy. The strong demand for English (2,343) over Arabic (907) is a significant signal many roles are internationally oriented or targeting Gulf markets where English is the business language. 🎓 Most Requested Academic Backgrounds (See chart: Top Majors in Demand) HR -- 2,187 (largest, reflects organizational need) Management -- 2,121 Media -- 1,658 Marketing -- 1,492 CS -- 1,106 IT -- 1,065 Graphic Design -- 869 HR leading the list is a notable finding, it suggests significant organizational hiring activity and a maturing private sector even in crisis conditions. Architecture (338), Law (216) rank low not because they're unimportant, but because the market isn't creating new jobs in those fields at anywhere near the same rate. Takeaway for students: IT, CS, HR, and digital media are where the demand is. 🏭 Industries Hiring Most (See chart below: Top Industries) Development -- 5,533 Software -- 3,042 Media -- 1,658 IT -- 1,065 Then a long tail: Retail (633), Training (630), NGO (474), Insurance (478), Medical (452), Hospital (430), Finance (423), Hospitality (316). The Finance sector's surprisingly low ranking is notable, Lebanon used to export banking talent across the entire Arab world. The near-collapse of the banking sector post-2019 is written directly into this chart. 🌍 Gulf Cities Recruiting Lebanese Talent (See chart below: Top Gulf Cities Hiring Lebanese Talent) KSA / Saudi Arabia -- ~482 combined mentions (LARGEST recruiter) Kuwait -- ~209 mentions Dubai / UAE -- ~452 combined mentions Qatar -- ~164 mentions Oman -- ~118 mentions Bahrain -- ~10 mentions Saudi Arabia edges out the UAE as the top recruiter of Lebanese talent. Kuwait's strong showing is also underappreciated, it rarely gets discussed in the brain drain conversation but is clearly very active. 📍 Lebanese Cities with Most Job Activity (See chart below: Top Lebanese Cities with Job Posts) Beirut -- 2,507 (undisputed center) Sin el Fil --311 Dbayeh -- 289 Jbeil -- 232, Antelias -- 225, Zalka -- 221, Jounieh -- 219 The Mount Lebanon coastal corridor (Sin el Fil → Dbayeh → Antelias → Zalka → Jounieh) is clearly the secondary economic belt after Beirut. Tripoli (131) and Bekaa (121) lag significantly, confirming persistent geographic inequality in economic opportunity. 💵 The USD Salary Crisis. The Most Important Number Only 562 out of 20,802 postings, 2.7% ,explicitly offer USD salaries. With the lira at 89,000+ to the dollar and having lost ~98% of its value since 2019, the vast majority of local jobs still denominate salaries in a currency that is functionally worthless for savings, planning, or covering import-dependent expenses. A USD salary in Lebanon today isn't a perk. It's the difference between being able to afford basic food and medicine or not. The scarcity of USD jobs locally is, in my view, the single biggest driver of brain drain, more so than Gulf recruitment itself. Gulf recruiters aren't stealing Lebanese talent. They're simply offering what Lebanon stopped being able to provide: a stable income. 💻 Remote Work. A Missed Opportunity Only 220 remote positions detected (1.1% of all posts). Lebanon should be a remote work paradise on paper: highly educated, trilingual, tech-savvy talent at a fraction of Western labor costs. The infrastructure problems (electricity, internet reliability) are the main barrier. 📌 Key Takeaways For Lebanese job seekers: Learn Python, JavaScript, SAP, or cloud skills (AWS). Prioritize English. If staying in Lebanon, make USD compensation non-negotiable. For students choosing a major: HR, Management, CS, and IT have the strongest demand. The big picture: Lebanon has functionally become a talent incubator for the Gulf. We train some of the best professionals in the Arab world in trilingual, internationally-oriented universities and then watch them leave because we can't offer a stable currency to pay them in. The brain drain isn't a social problem. It's a macroeconomic arithmetic problem. And 2.7% USD salaries is the equation. ‼️ Methodology note: Data extracted via Python keyword-matching on 20,802 Telegram job posts spanning January 2021 to February 2026. Limitations include false positives from short keywords and undercounting of roles not explicitly labeled with keywords. Charts updated to fix keyword matching issues. Happy to answer questions or do deeper breakdowns by sector. Most requested academic backgrounds. HR and Management lead, followed by Media and Marketing. CS and IT sit at similar realistic levels (~1,100 each). Charts corrected with word boundary keyword matching. Top skills in demand. 20,802 Lebanese Telegram job posts (Jan 2021–Feb 2026). Communication, Sales, and Excel lead, followed by strong tech demand in Java, JavaScript, Python and cloud tools. Gulf countries &amp; cities recruiting Lebanese talent. Lebanese cities by job posting volume. Beirut leads overwhelmingly. The Mount Lebanon coastal corridor (Sin el Fil → Dbayeh → Antelias → Zalka → Jounieh) is the clear secondary economic belt. Industries hiring most. Development and Software dominate, confirming Lebanon's pivot toward export-oriented tech services. Note Finance's low ranking. The banking sector collapse is visible here. &#32; submitted by &#32; /u/Gepoo13 [link] &#32; [comments]",

      "text": "Forgive me if I'm using a translator, but English is not my everyday language. I'm from Poland and writing this post because there are almost nine months left until the UNIFIL mission expires on 31 December of this year. Furthermore, there have been reports in the media that an EU training mission might emerge to replace UNIFIL. However, there are no details yet on what this mission will ultimately look like. From what I understand, Italy is expected to leave its troops in Lebanon after the mandate ends, meaning Italian soldiers will no longer operate as Blue Helmets. The UNIFIL mission, which numbered 7,538 Blue Helmets on 1 February 2026, is scheduled to be further reduced by May. The Polish soldiers' mission in Lebanon is scheduled to last until 31 August of this year, but it remains unclear whether the mission will be extended until the end of the year. Therefore, many questions remain unanswered: Does the Lebanese Army have the capacity to take over some or all of the UNIFIL mission's infrastructure and positions? If not, how should the LAF be strengthened in the near future to fully take control of border protection? What would an EU training mission look like? Are there any ideas on how the LAF should be strengthened to independently repel potential attacks and conduct counterterrorism operations against internal threats? If the Polish Army were to withdraw on August 31st, four months before the UNIFIL mandate expires, would this not damage Poland's relations with Lebanon? In my opinion, the UNIFIL mission failed to protect the Blue Line and failed to prevent a war between Israel and Hezbollah, and the patrols failed to prevent it, despite attempts. Furthermore, given the situation related to the war in Ukraine, it is also crucial for Poland to maintain armored equipment on NATO's eastern flank to maintain deterrence. I don't want to go into great detail here, but there's often talk of increasing armored forces. From my perspective, ending the war will be very difficult, but at the same time, I believe action is needed to prevent the same thing from happening as in Afghanistan, where the government collapsed and most people fled the country wherever they could. The question is, however, does Lebanon have a plan to prevent this situation, and can Lebanon cope without UNIFIL? &#32; submitted by &#32; /u/Teoriador [link] &#32; [comments]",

I’m thinking about taking a serious step and thinking to ask for her dad’s number, but I’m afraid of a couple of things.She’s in the US, I’m in malaysia 2 diff countries. If she does give me her dad’s number n I reach out, he might be like How do u even know my daughter? I’m scared he might get really angry if he finds out she’s been talking to a guy online. I don’t know how strict he is. What if he thinks she’s talking to men online. I’d hate for that to cause her problems at home or put her in a bad situation. The last thing I want is for her to get in trouble because of me. Another thing, he might think I’m some random guy trying to use her, like I just want a visa to come to the US or some kind of benefit. I don’t want him thinking I have bad intentions. And to be real, I’m not working right now. I am only a student. But I come from a good, respected family and financially very good. So before I make any move… what’s the right way to do ?

      "title": "Ramadan in aden yemen",
      "text": "Aden Before the spread of modern media, the methods for sighting the crescent moon of Ramadan relied on old oral traditions. In Aden, the process was carried out in traditional ways similar to other Islamic cities. Trusted religious figures would climb to high places in the mountains or go out toward the sea to ensure a clear view of the horizon. “Al-Bomba” in the area of Sirah was a well-known location. A point near the sea was chosen because of its clear horizon, making it suitable for sighting the crescent. Once the moon was confirmed, the musaharati (the pre-dawn caller) would be informed to announce the beginning of Ramadan, as declared by respected sheikhs. Supplications and Ramadan chants would then fill the mosques, creating a deeply spiritual atmosphere across the city. This was a common tradition in many Islamic cities before modern media existed. In the past, before radio and television, the musaharati played an important role in waking people in Aden for the pre-dawn meal (suhoor). People used to sleep early and did not stay up late as many do today watching television or spending time in markets. Like many Arab and Islamic cities, Aden had inherited Ramadan traditions, and the musaharati was part of its cultural and social fabric. He would walk through the old neighborhoods of Aden using a drum or tambourine, sometimes accompanied by a chanter who recited religious hymns and supplications. He often called out the names of well-known residents, adding a personal and warm touch to the tradition. During the period of British rule in Aden, local customs were influenced by modern urban life. However, the musaharati remained present in some popular neighborhoods. After the rise of radio and television, his role gradually declined. Religious programs and Ramadan chants were broadcast, and people began relying more on these modern means. Later, the Crescent and Holidays Committee affiliated with the municipality announced such occasions through radio and television. Despite this decline, the memory of the musaharati remains deeply rooted in the hearts of many Aden residents, symbolizing warmth, unity, and the communal spirit of Ramadan nights. As for the Ramadan cannon in Aden, its history dates back to before the British occupation. It was used to announce the time of breaking the fast and the time of imsak (beginning of fasting). The Ramadan cannon continued to be used even after independence. It helped organize fasting times through a loud and widely heard signal, reaching surrounding areas. The cannon was fired twice daily: At sunset to signal iftar (breaking the fast). At dawn to signal imsak (start of fasting). Three cannons were installed in elevated areas of Aden, including Jebel Hadid to ensure the sound reached across the city and nearby districts such as Khor Maksar, Al Mansoura, and Sheikh Othman. Before that, there had been an old cannon on Jebel Ma'ashiq, another in the Tawahi area (Al-Banjasar), and one on Jebel Al Qalua. After independence in 1967, the Ramadan cannon tradition continued for a short period but gradually declined with the spread of modern media and technology, which made it easier to determine prayer and fasting times accurately. &#32; submitted by &#32; /u/alihedgehog73839 [link] &#32; [comments]",

Children took part by singing and welcoming the arrival of the holy month of Ramadan. On the 21st of Sha‘ban, both adults and children in Al-Qadi quarter celebrated the occasion. The event was broadcast live on social media platforms, spreading joy among people despite the difficult circumstances the country is going through due to war and the economic collapse that has heavily affected citizens’ livelihoods. Young girls wore colorful makhawer (traditional dresses) in various designs, a garment traditionally worn by women during Ramadan as part of local custom. The children wore small ma‘awiz (wrap skirts), shamzan (the well-known Adeni vest), and shirts, carrying lanterns of different sizes that added to the festive Ramadan spirit. Oud player Ayman Murad said, “It was a beautiful day. I was truly happy to be a reason for bringing joy to the hearts of my people and the children. I am proud to sing for Al-Qadi quarter and its kind residents. Thanks to everyone who contributed to the success of this Sha‘baniyah evening, which was widely appreciated.” Munther Mohammed stated that Al-Qadi quarter is a proud example for all neighborhoods of Crater and is always at the forefront in reviving such old religious traditions of our beloved city of Aden. Diaa Sarouri wrote on a video of the Sha‘baniyah that he shared, “Al-Qadi quarter was different last night.” He mentioned that he watched a live broadcast on Facebook and praised the revival of popular heritage among children. Many social media posts expressed that it is beautiful to revive these Adeni traditions and bring joy to children’s hearts, calling for the continuation of such occasions and old customs to keep them alive once again. &#32; submitted by &#32; /u/alihedgehog73839 [link] &#32; [comments]",

All throughout my life, from what I've seen, I feel like I am the only Yemeni in my city who deals with this. For some context, my father is from Ibb and my mother from Taiz. I grew up in NYC with my mother and her family because my parents are divorced. I love both my parents, and I love my mother's side of my family; however, their behavior over the years has infuriated me. The problem with them is that they seem to let everything and anything slide without speaking up. Both old friends and their own relatives have betrayed them over the years. But when they bump into these old friends, or they visit/call their relatives, they're nothing but smiles and never mention what they did. The first and worst betrayal comes from a family that was once close friends of my family. I will refer to them as &quot;the fakes&quot;. I can't be too detailed in case someone who knows me sees this post, but my neighborhood has a large number of Middle Eastern stores and restaurants, so it's not hard to find it. For context, the majority of the Yemeni's in my neighborhood (at least those I see/know), come from Ibb, Aden, and Taiz. When I was in high school, I also met and knew people from Yafa, Radaa, and Ibb. A majority of both my neighborhoods, Yemeni's from Ibb and the NY Yemeni's in general, come from a village called &quot;Sharih&quot; and the areas surrounding it. When 'the fakes&quot; first came to America, they decided to change their name to a new one instead of their original one. The name they chose is very similar to that of my mother's family, but I cannot say it in case someone I know reads this post. They were actually my family's neighbors in our old neighborhood in the east of Brooklyn. They got along very well before they moved to where we live now. When they moved to our current neighborhood, the Yemeni's they would meet would ask them if they were from my family's Usra/Tribe, which is large and well known. Upon learning about this, they lied and stuck with it. They began to call us less often. When my family moved to the neighborhood, people would be confused when they would explain that it was us who belonged to our tribe and not the fakes. Some of the people from their family have admitted that we are the real members of our Usra, but not all of them. Along with that, our family is no better. Many years ago, my mother's cousins spread lies about my mother and her siblings, saying that they cause trouble and gossip (ironic), and this caused my great aunts to call less often, which further divided the family. These extended relatives, at least the women, seem never to call, and they didn't even come to the funeral of one of our great aunts. My father's side is no better. They sold his store in NY behind his back, and convinced him to divorce my mother for someone from their village. My father's siblings convinced him to leave my mother for one of their sisters-in-law. He divorced his 2nd wife soon after and has regretted his decision ever since. There are also random people who just hate my family, even though we did nothing to them. Over 10 years ago, one of my aunts got a call from the hospital, and she was told that they caught one of their employees looking through her medical records and other patients' records. They asked if she wanted her to be reprimanded, and she said yes. That employee happened to be Yemeni, and she happens to be friends with &quot;the fakes&quot; as well. What are the odds lol? I was in the grocery store with my mom last month, and she told me to wait outside because there was a woman there she didn't want to see me. Later, she told me she used to be friends with her siblings and would even sleep over sometimes, but they cut us off and stopped contacting us. Guess who she's friends with? THE FAKES! I could go on and on, but I'll stop here. If I shared any more details, my family members or the people I mentioned may make a big deal out of it. Has anyone else here dealt with horrible people in the Yemeni community and wider diaspora? What about terrible relatives? I constantly wonder, what happened to people's Adab? Why betray your friends and family members when they did nothing to you? I always see everyone else in the NYC community with their siblings, cousins, and other family members, running successful businesses. Driving nice cars. Going to each other's weddings. I deleted Instagram because I feel mildly depressed just watching every other Yemeni I know enjoying the things I don't have in my life. But I guess this is just Allah's way of testing me. I also apologize for how long this post is; it took me more than a week to finish it, as this topic stresses me out greatly. Anyway, Ramadan Mubarak! TLDR: My mother's side of my family is envious, divided, and doesn't care much about each other. My dad's side is no better for different reasons. Ex-friends stole our last name, gossiped, and betrayed us. It feels like no one else in the Yemeni community deals with this stuff, and my family is the exception. Have you dealt with our heard of anything similar to this? &#32; submitted by &#32; /u/FuzzyTurtle856 [link] &#32; [comments]",
